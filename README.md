As one of the author of the journal "Menganalisis Kualitas Apel Menggunakan Metode Gaussian Naive Bayes," I contributed to the development and implementation of a machine learning model aimed at classifying and predicting apple quality. My primary responsibilities included data preprocessing, such as handling missing values and transforming categorical variables, as well as visualizing data result for Gaussian Naive Bayes modeling. This project underscores the potential of machine learning in advancing agricultural practices and decision-making processes.
